# raymarched-sundial

This is a small demo of a sundial in a desert, intended to be run in [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com).

## Building
In order to run in shadertoy, run `python3 make.py cat` and copy the contents
of main.glsl into shadertoy. Likewise, copy the shadertoy script into main.glsl
and run `python3 make.py uncat` in order to save changes.
